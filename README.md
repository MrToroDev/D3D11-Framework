If you came here, this is a branch where i test some win32 features before
pushing in the master branch.
For now im working on migrate from GLFW to Win32API for some customization and 
for ImGui MultiViewport feature.

Anything you see and download here it's just some code that need's to be tested
or need to be fixed.
To make sure that you know if the code in this branch works, i'll put this table
with some information that could be util.

| NAME  | PARAMETER | DESC |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Build | Working   |      |

(this can seem very odd, but is the only way i can update the status of this branch)
